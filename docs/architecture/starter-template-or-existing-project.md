**N/A - Greenfield project**

This is a greenfield project built from scratch using vanilla PHP, jQuery, and SQLite. The technology stack is deliberately constrained to avoid framework complexity while maintaining a clear evolution path toward modern frameworks as the project scales.

**Technology Constraints:**
- Vanilla PHP (no frameworks initially)
- jQuery for frontend interactions  
- SQLite for data persistence
- Monorepo structure
- DigitalOcean App Platform deployment

**Evolution Path Planned:**
Monolith → Enhanced services → Framework adoption → Microservices (as project scales)
