# Story 1.8: Tournament Management Dashboard

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Site Administrator,
**I want** To view, edit, and manage all tournaments regardless of status,
**so that** I can handle tournament updates, corrections, extensions, and status changes for operational needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A protected admin page "/admin/tournaments.php" displays all tournaments in a searchable table.
2. The table shows Tournament Title, Status, Host, Registration Status, Parse Date, and Actions.
3. Each row includes action buttons: View Details, Edit Tournament, Change Status.
4. "Edit Tournament" opens the same edit form as Story 1.6 but accessible for all tournament statuses.
5. Tournament status can be changed between: pending_review, approved, rejected, extended, cancelled.
6. The page includes filtering by tournament status, game mode, and search by title/host.
7. Edit capabilities include all tournament fields: title, host, dates, links, rank range, etc.

## Dev Notes

### Implementation Context
This story addresses the broken admin navigation link to `/admin/tournaments.php` by creating a comprehensive tournament management interface. It extends beyond the basic review queue (Story 1.5) to provide full tournament lifecycle management.

### Enhanced Tournament Statuses
**Extended Status System**:
- `pending_review` - Newly parsed tournaments awaiting admin review
- `approved` - Approved tournaments visible to public
- `rejected` - Tournaments rejected by admins
- `extended` - Approved tournaments with extended deadlines
- `cancelled` - Tournaments that were cancelled after approval
- `archived` - Old tournaments moved to archive status

### Database Integration
**Leverages Existing Tournament Table Structure**:
- Extends existing `status` field validation to include new statuses
- Uses existing `approved_by` and `approved_at` fields for tracking
- Maintains compatibility with existing Tournament model methods
- Adds enhanced filtering and statistics capabilities

### Technology Stack Integration
- **Backend**: Vanilla PHP 8.1+ extending existing Tournament model
- **Frontend**: Pico.css styling with JavaScript modal interactions
- **Database**: SQLite with enhanced prepared statement queries
- **Authentication**: Existing osu! OAuth integration with SecurityHelper
- **Edit Integration**: Reuses existing edit form from Story 1.6

### File Structure Created
```
public/admin/tournaments.php                    # Main tournament management page
src/templates/admin/tournament-management.php   # Management interface template
```

### File Structure Enhanced
```
src/Models/Tournament.php                       # Enhanced with new methods:
                                                # - findWithFilters()
                                                # - updateTournamentStatus() 
                                                # - getTournamentStatistics()
```

### Security Implementation
- **Admin Authentication**: Protected by existing SecurityHelper::requireAdminAuth()
- **CSRF Protection**: All status change forms include CSRF tokens
- **HTML Escaping**: All tournament data escaped via SecurityHelper::escapeHtml()
- **Status Change Logging**: All status changes logged to system_logs with admin tracking
- **Input Validation**: Status values validated against allowed list

### Korean Language Features
- **Interface**: All labels, buttons, and messages in Korean
- **Status Labels**: Korean translations for all tournament statuses
- **Filter Controls**: Korean labels for all filter options
- **Modal Interface**: Korean confirmation dialogs and form labels
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Korean status summaries with color coding

### Performance Considerations
- **Pagination**: Limits displayed tournaments to 25 per page
- **Efficient Queries**: Uses indexed columns for filtering (status, parsed_at)
- **Statistics Caching**: Status counts calculated efficiently with GROUP BY
- **Search Optimization**: LIKE queries on indexed title field

### Integration with Story 1.6
**Edit Form Reuse Strategy**:
- Tournament management page links directly to existing `/admin/edit.php`
- Edit form enhanced to accept tournaments in any status (not just pending_review)
- Maintains existing edit form security and validation
- Preserves existing CSRF protection and admin authentication
- No duplication of edit functionality - clean separation of concerns

## Testing
**Testing Requirements**:
- **CRUD Operations**: Test tournament status changes for all status types
- **Search and Filter**: Verify all filter combinations work correctly
- **Edit Integration**: Confirm edit buttons navigate to working edit form
- **Security Testing**: Verify admin-only access and CSRF protection
- **Korean Interface**: Test Korean text display and timezone formatting
- **Status Change Logging**: Confirm all status changes appear in system logs
