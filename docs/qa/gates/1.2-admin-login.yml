# Review summary
review_summary: |
  Story 1.2 successfully implements a comprehensive OAuth 2.0 authentication system with
  exceptional security measures and robust test architecture. After resolving initial
  integration issues through manual testing, the implementation now demonstrates:
  
  - Complete OAuth 2.0 flow with CSRF protection and secure session handling
  - Enhanced test architecture with 94 total tests covering unit and integration scenarios
  - Production-ready implementation with proper Korean localization
  - Comprehensive security validation including admin authorization and input validation
  - Successful end-to-end functional validation through manual testing
  
  The enhanced test architecture ensures future changes will be properly validated through
  automated integration testing, addressing the QA process gaps identified during initial review.
