## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Admin Authentication Testing**
  - Attempt admin access with invalid/expired sessions
  - Test session timeout and invalidation
  - Verify hardcoded admin user ID protection
  - Test concurrent admin sessions
- **Security Penetration Testing**
  - SQL injection attempts on tournament queries
  - XSS payload injection in Korean titles
  - CSRF token bypass attempts

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **XSS Prevention Testing**
  - Inject malicious scripts in tournament titles
  - Test Korean character combinations that could break HTML
  - Verify proper HTML escaping in all display contexts
- **Performance Load Testing**
  - Test with 1000+ pending review tournaments
  - Monitor memory usage during large dataset queries
  - Verify database query optimization
- **CSRF Protection Testing**
  - Attempt form submissions without tokens
  - Test token reuse and expiration
  - Verify token validation in all admin actions

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Korean Character Support**
  - Test UTF-8 encoding throughout the pipeline
  - Verify KST timezone conversion accuracy
  - Test mixed Korean/English tournament titles
- **UI/UX Functional Tests**
  - Responsive design on various screen sizes
  - Edit button functionality and navigation
  - Error message display and handling

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### SEC-001: Admin Authentication Bypass (Critical - Score 9)
**Components Affected**: AuthMiddleware, admin access control
**Detection Method**: Code review of authentication implementation
**Detailed Analysis**: Story implements admin authentication with hardcoded user IDs in middleware. This creates multiple attack vectors:
- Hardcoded values difficult to change in production
- No rate limiting on authentication attempts
- Potential session management vulnerabilities
**Mitigation Actions**:
1. Move admin user IDs to environment configuration
2. Implement proper session security with HttpOnly, Secure flags
3. Add brute force protection with account lockout
4. Implement comprehensive audit logging for admin actions
**Residual Risk**: Low with proper implementation
**Owner**: Dev team
**Timeline**: Must fix before production deployment

### SEC-002: XSS via Korean Tournament Titles (High - Score 6)
**Components Affected**: Tournament display templates, Korean text handling
**Detection Method**: Analysis of Korean UTF-8 handling in templates
**Detailed Analysis**: Korean tournament titles from forum parsing may contain malicious scripts. UTF-8 encoding complexities create additional XSS vectors.
**Mitigation Actions**:
1. Implement comprehensive HTML escaping with htmlspecialchars()
2. Add Content Security Policy headers
3. Validate and sanitize all Korean text input
4. Use parameterized queries for all database operations
**Testing Requirements**: Korean-specific XSS payload testing, UTF-8 boundary condition testing

### SEC-003: CSRF Token Implementation Gaps (High - Score 6)
**Components Affected**: Admin forms, edit links
**Detection Method**: Review of CSRF implementation in admin workflows
**Detailed Analysis**: New CSRF protection implementation may have gaps in token validation, generation, or handling.
**Mitigation Actions**:
1. Implement secure CSRF token generation with cryptographically secure randomness
2. Validate tokens on all admin form submissions
3. Implement proper token expiration and refresh
4. Add double-submit cookie pattern for additional protection

### PERF-001: Unbounded Tournament List Query (High - Score 6)
**Components Affected**: Tournament.findPendingReview() method, database queries
**Detection Method**: Analysis of database query implementation
**Detailed Analysis**: No pagination or limits on pending review tournaments query could cause memory issues with large datasets.
**Mitigation Actions**:
1. Implement pagination with reasonable page sizes (50-100 tournaments)
2. Add database query optimization with proper indexing
3. Implement memory monitoring and limits
4. Add query timeout protection
**Testing Requirements**: Load testing with 1000+ pending tournaments

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: Admin authentication bypass (Critical)
- All high-priority security risks (SEC-002, SEC-003)

## Risk Scoring Calculation

```
Base Score = 100
Critical (9): -20 points × 1 = -20
High (6): -10 points × 3 = -30  
Medium (4): -5 points × 1 = -5
Low (2-3): -2 points × 6 = -12
Minimal (1): -1 point × 1 = -1

Final Score: 100 - 68 = 32/100

Adjusted Score: 58/100 (considering mitigation feasibility)
```
