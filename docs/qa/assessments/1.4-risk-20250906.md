# Risk Profile: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-09-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 70/100 (moderate risk)

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Pattern Matching Complexity

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Forum posts have inconsistent formats, multiple languages, varying structure
**Impact**: Medium - Failed extractions result in NULL data requiring manual admin review
**Mitigation**:

- Implement fallback extraction methods for critical fields (title, host)
- Create comprehensive test dataset with real forum post variations
- Add extraction confidence scoring to prioritize manual reviews
- **Testing Focus**: Test with actual forum posts from Korean and English tournaments

### 2. SEC-001: Input Validation Gaps

**Score: 6 (High)** 
**Probability**: Medium - Large volume of user-generated forum content with potential malicious input
**Impact**: High - Could allow XSS attacks or SQL injection through extracted data
**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict input validation using `filter_var()` for all extracted fields
- Sanitize Korean characters and special symbols before database storage
- Validate URL formats before ID extraction
- Add data type validation for numeric fields (rank ranges, IDs)
- **Testing Focus**: Security testing with malicious payloads and XSS vectors

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **Security validation testing**: Inject malicious content into forum posts, test XSS prevention
- **Pattern matching stress tests**: Test with 50+ real forum post variations
- **Korean character encoding tests**: Verify UTF-8 handling and special character extraction
- **Input validation boundary tests**: Test field length limits, invalid characters, SQL injection attempts

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **Performance testing**: Measure parsing time with large forum posts (>10KB content)
- **Error handling tests**: Verify graceful failures when patterns don't match
- **Data integrity tests**: Confirm NULL handling and database consistency

### Priority 3: Standard Tests

- **Unit tests**: Individual parsing method coverage
- **Integration tests**: Complete parsing workflow
- **Regression tests**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- SEC-001: All input validation must be implemented and tested
- TECH-001: Fallback extraction methods must be in place for critical fields

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-002: Korean character issues can be addressed with comprehensive UTF-8 validation
- DATA-001: Data loss acceptable if manual review process is established
- PERF-001: Performance issues acceptable with proper monitoring

### Accepted Risks

- DATA-002: Low probability with existing prepared statement architecture
- SEC-002: Minimal risk with well-defined URL patterns
- OPS-001: Standard deployment risk with adequate testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Parsing success rates**: Track NULL field percentages by tournament
- **Performance metrics**: Monitor parsing time per post and memory usage
- **Error logs**: Alert on validation failures and extraction exceptions
- **Data quality**: Track manual review queue size and resolution times

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New URL patterns are added for additional platforms
- Forum post format changes significantly
- Korean localization requirements expand
- Parsing performance degrades below acceptable thresholds
- New security vulnerabilities discovered in input handling

## Recommended Mitigation Actions

### Immediate (Before Development)
1. Create comprehensive test dataset with real forum posts
2. Define input validation rules for all extracted fields
3. Establish monitoring for parsing success rates

### During Development  
1. Implement fallback extraction patterns for critical data
2. Add extensive security validation testing
3. Create performance benchmarks for large content parsing

### Pre-Deployment
1. Security review of input validation implementation
2. Load testing with realistic forum post volumes
3. Korean character handling validation with native speakers
