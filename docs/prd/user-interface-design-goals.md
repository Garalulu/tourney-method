# User Interface Design Goals

*   **Overall UX Vision:** The UX will be defined by speed and simplicity. To achieve a modern aesthetic with minimal overhead, the project will adopt a lightweight, class-less CSS framework (e.g., **Pico.css**).
*   **Theme Support:** The interface must support both **light and dark color schemes**, ideally automatically detecting the user's operating system preference.
*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:**
    *   **Filter-First:** The primary way users will interact with the site is by applying powerful filters to the main tournament list.
    *   **Drill-Down:** The core navigation flow will be a simple "list -> detail" pattern. Users select a tournament from the list to drill down into its specific details.
*   **Core Screens and Views:**
    *   **Public:**
        1.  Tournament List (Homepage)
        2.  Tournament Detail Page
    *   **Admin:**
        1.  Login Page
        2.  Admin Dashboard (Review Queue)
        3.  Edit Tournament Form
        4.  System Logs Viewer
*   **Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA**
    *   The project will aim to meet WCAG AA standards to ensure it is usable by as many people as possible. This includes using strong color contrast, semantic HTML, and ensuring keyboard navigability.
*   **Branding:**
    *   There is no formal branding. The aesthetic will be guided by the chosen lightweight CSS framework, ensuring a clean, modern, and consistent look across the entire application.
*   **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**
    *   The site must be fully functional and easy to use on both desktop and mobile web browsers.
