# Epic List

**Epic 1: Core Data Pipeline & Admin Foundation**
*   **Goal:** To establish the project's technical foundation and build the complete, automated data pipeline, from parsing forum posts to saving admin-approved tournament data in the database. At the end of this epic, the system will be correctly collecting and storing high-quality data, even though it won't be visible to the public yet.

**Epic 2: Public Interface & Launch**
*   **Goal:** To build the public-facing, responsive website that allows any user to view, filter, and search the tournament data collected in Epic 1. This epic makes the data useful to the community and comprises all the work needed to achieve the MVP launch.
