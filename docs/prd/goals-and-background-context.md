# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
*   To provide osu! players with a centralized, reliable, and easy-to-use platform to discover tournaments.
*   To provide tournament organizers with a more effective platform to gain visibility for their events.
*   To automate the manual process of collecting and curating tournament information, saving significant time and effort.
*   To establish a foundational platform that can later be expanded with more community-focused features.

### Background Context
The osu! tournament scene is a vibrant and growing part of the community. However, the tools for managing it have not kept pace. Information is fragmented across the official forums, where posts are easily lost, and dozens of individual Discord servers. This makes it difficult for players to find tournaments and for organizers to reach an audience.

This project, "Tourney Method," aims to solve this problem by creating a single source of truth. It will automatically parse tournament announcements, structure the data, and present it in a clean, searchable interface. This will eliminate the manual work currently required, reduce frustration for both players and organizers, and provide a solid foundation for a thriving tournament ecosystem.
