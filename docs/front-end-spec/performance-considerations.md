# Performance Considerations

## Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** < 2 seconds on standard internet connection
- **Interaction Response:** < 100ms for filter applications and modal opens
- **Animation FPS:** 60fps for smooth micro-interactions and transitions

## Design Strategies

**Image Optimization:**
- Tournament banners lazy-loaded only when needed
- WebP format with fallbacks for better compression
- Responsive image sizing for different breakpoints
- Placeholder/skeleton loading states

**Code Efficiency:**
- Minimal JavaScript - progressive enhancement approach
- CSS optimized for reusability and minimal specificity
- Component-based architecture reduces code duplication
- Critical CSS inlined for faster initial render

**Data Loading:**
- Default 10 tournaments minimizes initial payload
- Pagination (25/50) loads additional content on demand
- Filter results cached for instant re-application
- Modal content loaded only when opened

**Network Optimization:**
- Minimize HTTP requests through careful asset bundling
- Leverage browser caching for static assets
- Compress text assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
- CDN considerations for global accessibility
